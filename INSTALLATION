REQUIREMENTS

You need Objective Caml 4.02 or later, ocamlbuild, and GNU make.

HOW TO INSTALL

If you wish to install via ocamlfind, make sure that ocamlfind is in
your PATH. (Remember that prefixing a command with sudo affects its
PATH.)

Run the following commands:

  make PREFIX=/usr/local all
  make PREFIX=/usr/local install

If your machine does not have the native code Objective Caml compiler
(ocamlopt), but does have the bytecode compiler (ocamlc), then instead
of the above command, use:

  make PREFIX=/usr/local TARGET=byte all
  make PREFIX=/usr/local TARGET=byte install

The value of the PREFIX variable can be changed to control where
the software, the standard library, and the documentation should
be stored. These files are copied to the following places:

  $PREFIX/bin/
  $PREFIX/share/menhir/
  $PREFIX/doc/menhir/

The support library, MenhirLib, is either installed via ocamlfind or placed
within $PREFIX/share/menhir. By default, ocamlfind is used if it is found in
the PATH. This decision may be overridden by setting USE_OCAMLFIND to either
true or false when running "make all".

Menhir's --suggest options help determine where and how MenhirLib was installed.

The documentation includes a reference manual and a number of demos.
